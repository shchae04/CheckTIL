# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Korean language TIL (Today I Learned) repository containing technical documentation, study notes, and learning materials for software development concepts. The repository is primarily focused on backend development, computer science fundamentals, and interview preparation.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into the following main categories:

### Core Directories

- **CS/**: Computer Science fundamentals
  - `Algorithms/`: Algorithm implementations and explanations (includes Java code)
  - `Database/`: Database concepts, design patterns, and technologies
  - `SystemArchitecture/`: System design, backend architecture patterns
  - `Web/`: Web technologies and security concepts
  - `Networking/`: Network protocols and concepts
  - `OperatingSystems/`: OS concepts and system-level topics
  - `Concurrency/`: Parallel programming and concurrency control

- **Interview/**: Interview preparation materials and common technical questions

- **Web/**: Web development topics
  - `JavaScript/`: JavaScript-specific concepts and frameworks
  - `Server/`: Server technologies (Nginx, Tomcat, serverless, etc.)

- **Automation/**: DevOps and automation tools (GitOps, CI/CD, n8n workflows)

- **Git/**: Git-related documentation and best practices

### Key Files

- `study.md`: Main study guide focusing on backend development skills including RESTful APIs, databases, Docker, and system architecture
- Files are primarily in Korean language
- Content focuses on practical backend development skills and system design

## Content Characteristics

- **Language**: All documentation is in Korean
- **Focus Area**: Backend development, system architecture, database design
- **Target Audience**: Backend developers, interview preparation, computer science students
- **Content Type**: Technical explanations, practical examples, architecture patterns

## Development Notes

- No build system or package management files present
- Contains one Java file: `CS/Algorithms/TwoStackQueue.java` - a queue implementation using two stacks
- Repository is documentation-focused with minimal code
- Uses git for version control with staged changes for various topics

## Working with this Repository

When modifying or adding content:

1. **File Organization**: Follow the existing directory structure based on technical domains
2. **Language**: Maintain Korean language for consistency with existing content
3. **Content Style**: Use clear technical explanations with practical examples
4. **Cross-references**: Many files reference related concepts in other parts of the repository
5. **Interview Focus**: Content often includes interview preparation aspects and real-world application examples

## Common Topics

The repository covers key backend development areas:

- RESTful API design and implementation
- Database design, modeling, and optimization
- System architecture patterns (3-tier architecture, microservices)
- Concurrency control and transaction management
- Web server vs WAS concepts
- Docker and containerization
- Security patterns (OAuth2, authentication strategies)
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- DevOps and automation practices

## Note on Content Updates

When adding new content, ensure it aligns with the repository's focus on practical backend development skills and includes both theoretical understanding and real-world application examples.
